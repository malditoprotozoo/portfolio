                Hi again! My name is Victoria 'Tori' Rodr√≠guez and as you may know, I'm a front-end developer.
                I'm 28 years old and I live in Santiago de Chile. Learning is my biggest passion and programming
                is a close second.

                I've been in love with techology since I got my first Atari, but only recently I decided to pursue it as a career.
                The last 6 months I've been part of Laboratoria's bootcamp for women and I swear the all-nighters have been worth it.
                <span className="separator" />
                <span className="mini-title">{'<'}freeTime{'>'}</span>
                On my free time I enjoy binge watching Netflix (oops), reading fiction, writing and reading fanfics
                and spending time with my beautiful family.
